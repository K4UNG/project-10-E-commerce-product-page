### What I learned

This challenge made me realise that I'm still need to do a lot of layouts. It took way longer than I thought it'd be and some of the parts were a bit tedious which I still have to improve. This is also my first time doing mobile-first workflow and overall I learned a lot and I'm happy with what I got.
